        <h2>Numerical Methods</h2>

        <p>
            The complex many-body systems are often intractable 
            using analytical methods, and hence one has to rely on numerical 
            techniques. One obvious method is to solve the many-body 
            Schroedinger's equation using the exact diagonalization (ED) methods. 
            However, due to the exponential growth of the 
            Hilbert space dimension with the system size, it is absolutely 
            impossible to access the physics of a larger system. To circumvent this 
            problem, several powerful methods have been developed to study the 
            quantum many-body systems such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) 
            method and other Matrix Product State (MPS) based methods. In this page, I will 
            provide an overview of these numerical methods.

                            In principle, the exact diagonalization (ED) method allows us to calculate the full spectrum 
                            of the Hamiltonian describing a particular system. The method is 
                            based on three major steps, namely (a) create appropriate basis 
                            states, (b) compute the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian using the 
                            basis states and (c) diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix to obtain 
                            the eigenspectrum. With the help of the eigenstates and eigenenergies, 
                            we can study the physical properties of the system. However, as mentioned above, 
                            due to the exponential growth of the 
                            Hilbert space dimension with the system size, it is absolutely 
                            impossible to access the physics of a larger system.
                            Lanczos or Arnoldi method makes it little more efficient if we are only interested in 
                            lowe-lying states, which is often sufficient for qualitative studies.

                            The Cluster Mean-Field Theory (CMFT) approach is one of the simplest 
                            methods which utilizes the ED method and the mean-field (MF) 
                            decoupling approximations to simplify a 
                            many-body problem. In this method, one divides the entire many-body 
                            system into small small clusters of finite size, as shown in the figure. 
                            While the Hamiltonian of the individual cluster is treated exactly, 
                            the couplings between the clusters are treated in a mean-field way.
                            In this method, the accuracy of the results increases with the cluster size. 
                            Unlike the MF approach, the CMFT allows for the calculation of 
                            off-site correlation functions within the cluster. This makes the 
                            CMFT method more accurate than the simple mean-field theory approach 
                            and can capture the qualitative picture of the system with less 
                            computing effort than the powerful Quantum Monte Carlo 
                            method.

                            The matrix product states (MPSs) are the widely used in quantum information 
                            theory and theoretical physics, especially to study the strongly correlated systems.
                            These are simple and efficient tensor network representation of the quantum many-body states. An 
                            example of such state is one-dimensional AKLT 
                            state that can be converted to MPS exactly. 
                            A most general wave function for this system can be written as
                            \begin{equation}\label{eq:genState}
                                |\Psi\rangle = \sum\limits_{\sigma_1,...,\sigma_L} c_{\sigma_1...\sigma_L} {|\sigma_1,...,\sigma_L\rangle}.
                            \end{equation}
                            In MPS form the exponentially many coefficients $c_{\sigma_1...\sigma_L}$ compressed to
                            \begin{equation}\label{eq:lcMPS}
                                |\Psi\rangle = \sum\limits_{a_1,...,a_L} A_{a_1}^{\sigma_1} A_{a_1,a_2}^{\sigma_2}...A_{a_{L-2},a_{L-1}}^{\sigma_{L-1}} A_{a_{L-1}}^{\sigma_{L}}{|\sigma_1,...,\sigma_L\rangle}.
                            \end{equation}
                            The sungular value decomposition (SVD) is used to perform compression.

                            The Density Matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method is the prescription to prevent the 
                            exponential growth of the Hilbert space while providing accurate results for low dimensional systems. Steve White 
                            proposed the method in 1992 as an improvement over the 
                            numerical renormalization group (NRG). The method finds the ground state of the system 
                            by variational approximation through local optimization. As a further development, the 
                            DMRG method was then applied to MPSs that increased the flexibility and power of the DMRG method by 
                            manyfold. The key idea here is to minimize the bond dimension ($a_i$) of the MPS by 
                            eliminating a part of the singular value spectrum that is negligible in weight. For 
                            example, in the low entangled states like the gapped state, the singular 
                            values ($\lambda_k$) decrease exponentially with its spectral position ($k$),
                            \begin{equation}
                                \lambda_k \propto e^{-\alpha k}, ~~~ \alpha > 0.

                            The time evolution of a quantum state of a strongly correlated 
                            many-body system with time-dependent Hamiltonian is a highly 
                            nontrivial problem. Because of the tremendous success of the DMRG 
                            method in addressing the equilibrium properties of strongly 
                            correlated systems, different attempts have been made to study 
                            non-equilibrium properties using the time-dependent DMRG 
                            method. G. Vidal 
                            developed an algorithm to simulate the time evolution of the 
                            many-body states. In the algorithm, the 
                            Hilbert space dynamically adapts itself for better accuracy. This 
                            algorithm is called the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD), which 
                            fits perfectly with the MPS framework.
